                    Genshin Impact is an open-world, action role-playing game that allows the player<br>
                    to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between<br>
                    characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several<br>
                    different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their abilities<br>
                    enhanced in various ways, mainly through directly leveling them up and improving the<br>
                    artifacts and weapons that a character can equip. In addition to exploration,<br>the player
                    can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses<br>and challenges
                    that reward highly valuable resources, but claiming them uses up a currency called <br>Original Resin,
                    which slowly regenerates over time. Completing these challenges grants the player<br>progress towards
                    increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges,<br> and raises theWorld Level.
                    The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the<br> world are and the rarity of rewards that
                    defeating them gives.


                    The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding, all limited by stamina.
                    Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an ice path that can aid the player in traversing terrain.
                    Many teleportation points exist throughout the world that players can warp to as a form of fast travel; among these are landmarks known as Statues of The Seven that can heal and revive characters, and provide benefits such as increasing player stamina.
                    Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength.
                    Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from in-game shops. Furthermore, there are special battle instances called "Domains" that reward materials which increase character and weapon strength.
                    Meals cooked from ingredients gathered in the overworld may also provide desirable effects, such as regenerating characters' health or boosting various stats. Players can also procure ore that can be refined and then used to create weapons or enhance their strength.
